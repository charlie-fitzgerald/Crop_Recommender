Crop recommendation application using machine learning with Python

User Guide 
Step 0: Make sure your computer has Python installed. This application was developed with Python version 3.12.3, so make sure that you have a compatible version installed. If you need to download Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python.

Step 1: Extract the code and other necessary files from the .zip archive that was submitted. Extract the files to a location of your choosing. Typical software used for unzipping files are WinRAR and 7-Zip.

Step 2: Using the command line, use the cd command to move into the directory of the unzipped files. You can copy the file path of the unzipped folder as shown in the screenshot below to make this step easier:

Navigate to the folder using a command line interface. To open the terminal on Windows, press the Windows Key + R, then type ‘cmd’ (without quotes) and hit enter. Then you can use the cd command in your terminal to move to the correct directory. Type cd, then paste or type your folder location, and press enter. After you run the command, you should see the directory where you unzipped the files displayed. The command is demonstrated below:

If you already have some of the packages installed, you will see ‘Requirement already satisfied’ next to the package in the console. Allow some time for all required packages to finish downloading.


Step 4: Type “python main.py” on the command line and press enter to start the application.

Step 5: In the application window, fill out all of the entry fields with values that are within the range provided. The range is inclusive. You can type in numbers for all of the entry fields, or use the arrows next to the entry fields to provide input. Only numbers are allowed to be typed into the entry fields. Any non-numeric inputs are not allowed to be typed in.
*Note: If any fields are left blank, or have values outside of the provided range, there will be an error when you click submit, and you will be asked to ensure that your inputs are entered correctly. Please refer to the following screenshots:
